This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analyst-nanodegree--nd008) (formerly known as Business Analyst Nanodegree)

### Project 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx

A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

- Proj 1.1: [Predicting Diamond Prices](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P1/P1%20-%20Diamond%20prices/P1_diamond_prices.pdf)

A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. You will apply a
framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a
recommendation.

- Proj 1.2: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P1/P1%20-%20Catalog%20Retail/P1_predict_catalog_retail.pdf)

Learnings: 
> structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics </br>
> how to select the most appropriate analytical methodology </br>
> implement a predictive model (linear regression) </br>

### Project 2: Data Wrangling : Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx

A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. You will use data preparation techniques to build
a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

- Project 2.1a: [Data Cleanup](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P2/P2_create_an_analytical_dataset/p2.1a-create-an-analytical-dataset.pdf)
- Project 2.1b: [Predictive modeling to select the best location](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P2/P2_create_an_analytical_dataset/p2.1b-recommend-a-city.pdf)

You’re a business intelligence analyst for a wholesaler of various food products. You’re in charge of putting together analytics dashboards for management. They have requested that you focus on one area of the business and create a dashboard that provides various summary statistics related to that area.

- Project 2.2: [SQL - Create Reports from Database](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P2/P2_create_reports/p2.2-create-reports-northwind.pdf)

Learnings: 
> understand common data types and sources of data </br>
> clean and organize a messy dataset </br>
> identify and adjust for outliers </br>
> summarize, cross-tabulate, transpose, and reformat data to prepare a dataset for analysis </br>
> join and union data from different sources and formats </br>
