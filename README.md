This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analyst-nanodegree--nd008) (formerly known as Business Analyst Nanodegree)

### Project 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx

A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. The aim is to use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. Ihe goal is to identify the required
framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a
recommendation.

- Proj 1.2: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P1/P1%20-%20Catalog%20Retail/P1_predict_catalog_retail.pdf)

> structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics </br>
> how to select the most appropriate analytical methodology </br>
> implement a predictive model (linear regression) </br>

### Project 2: Data Wrangling : Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx

A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. The aim is to use data preparation techniques to build
a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

- Project 2.1a: [Data Cleanup](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P2/P2_create_an_analytical_dataset/p2.1a-create-an-analytical-dataset.pdf)
- Project 2.1b: [Predictive modeling to select the best location](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P2/P2_create_an_analytical_dataset/p2.1b-recommend-a-city.pdf)

You’re a business intelligence analyst for a wholesaler of various food products. You’re in charge of putting together analytics dashboards for management. They have requested that you focus on one area of the business and create a dashboard that provides various summary statistics related to that area.

- Project 2.2: [SQL - Create Reports from Database](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P2/P2_create_reports/p2.2-create-reports-northwind.pdf)

Learnings: 
> understand common data types and sources of data </br>
> clean and organize a messy dataset </br>
> identify and adjust for outliers </br>
> summarize, cross-tabulate, transpose, and reformat data to prepare a dataset for analysis </br>
> join and union data from different sources and formats </br>

### Project 3: Data Visualization in Tableau

You are a business analyst consultant and your client is a new movie production company looking to make a new movie. The client wants to make sure it’s successful to help make a name for the new company. They are relying on you to help understand movie trends to help inform their decision making. </br>
Question 1: [How have movie genres changed over time?](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pushkarbharambe#!/vizhome/movies-genre-over-time/Genresovertime) </br>
Question 2: [How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures?](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pushkarbharambe#!/vizhome/movies-paramount-vs-universal/Paramount_vs_Universal) </br>
Question 3: [How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not based on novels?](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pushkarbharambe#!/vizhome/movies-novel-based/Anovelstory)</br>

- Project 3: [Visualizing Movie Data](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P3/p3_movies_data_tableau_analysis.pdf)

Learnings:
> importance of data visualization and how it can be a game changer in the overall data science lifecycle
> how to encode different data types in visualizations
> how to select amongst different graphs/ charts available
> create Tableau public gallery

### Project 4: Classification Models by Alteryx

A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. The aim is to build and apply a classification model to
provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.

- Project 4: [Creditworthiness: Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P4/P4-bank-default-risk.pdf)

Learnings:
> understand the fundamentals of classification modeling and how it differs from modeling numeric data </br>
> build logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and boosted models; use stepwise to automate predictor variables selection </br>
> score and compare models and interpret the results </br>

### Project 5: A/B Testing

A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. Design and analyze an A/B test and
write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

- Project 5: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P5/p5-AB-Testing.pdf)

Learnings:
> understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including selecting target and control units and variables and the duration of a test </br>
> Randomized design : select test and control variables and understand the importance of sample size and design a randomized design A/B test and analyze the results </br>
> Matched Pair design : match test units to control units and design a matched pair design A/B test and analyze the results </br>

### Project 6: Time Series Forecasting

A video game producer is planning production levels. Use time series forecasting models to forecast
monthly demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand.

- Project 6: [Forecast Video Game Sales](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P6/P6-forecasting-video-game-demand.pdf)

Learnings:
> understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data </br>
> use time series decomposition plots and build an ETS model </br>
> stationarize data through differencing, a process that prepares data for ARIMA modeling </br>

### Project 7: Segmentation and Clustering

A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. Use multiple analytical techniques to
provide recommendations on how to expand.  
- Project 7: Capstone Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone](https://github.com/pushkardps/Predictive_Analytics_For_Business/blob/master/P7/P7-grocery-store-expansion.pdf)

Learnings:
> Segmentation basics: understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation </br>
> Preparing data: scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling and select variables to include based on the business context </br>
> Variable Reduction: use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model </br>
> Clustering models: select the appropriate number of clusters; build and apply a k-centroid cluster model </br>
> Comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering results to complex business problems </br>
